LINTools displays the dynamic interactions between protein residues and ligand atoms based on the analysis of trajectory files in a manner similar to LigPlot.  It is known to work with gromacs .xtc and .gro or .pdb files, but in principle should be able to work with amber or charmm information as well (it relies on MDAnalysis for most back-end functionality).

The resulting output is in .svg format such that each of the components of the plot can be further manipulated for manuscripts within a vector graphics program like Adobe Illustrator.
